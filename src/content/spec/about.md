## REDACTED | Vulnerability Reseacher
Jan, 2023 - PRESENT 
- Researched embedded systems for potential vulnerabilities
- Reverse-Engineered binaries of various CPU architectures
- Found design flaws in both low-level and high-level components to
compose a stable exploit
- Conducted several research methodologies (static analysis,
dynamic analysis , blackbox testing)
- Reverse-Engineered and implemented dedicated protocols
- Developed PoCs for both binary and web exploits

## REDACTED | Vulnerability Research Analyst
Feb, 2021 - May, 2023
- Leveraged OSINT techniques to uncover potential vulnerable
embedded platforms, utilized Shodan, Censys and ZoomEye
- Mapped manufacturer-reseller relationships and segmented the
market for specific product categories
